1. Project Overview
In this project, I hosted a website on a cloud-based virtual machine. I launched an Ubuntu instance on Amazon EC2, installed and configured Nginx, allowed web traffic through a Security Group, and published a custom HTML page.

What this project covers

Provisioning a virtual server in the AWS cloud
Securing access with a key pair and security group rules
Connecting to a remote Linux server over SSH
Installing and managing a service with apt and systemd
Serving static content with Nginx
Making the service start automatically after a reboot
Testing, troubleshooting, and cleaning up cloud resources
Skills demonstrated

Area	Skill
Cloud	Launching and managing EC2 instances, AMIs, instance types
Networking	Security groups, ports 22 and 80, public IPs, inbound rules
Linux	SSH, file permissions, package management, systemctl, logs
Web servers	Nginx installation, document root, serving static files
Security	Key-based authentication, restricting SSH access
2. Architecture

Request flow

A visitor opens http://<public-ip> in a web browser.
The browser request reaches AWS through the VPC Internet Gateway.
The Security Group checks the rules. Port 80 is allowed, so the request passes.
Nginx receives the incoming HTTP request on port 80.
Nginx fetches index.html from its document root and sends the page back to the browser.
3. Core Concepts
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): A virtual server rented from AWS. You choose the operating system, CPU, memory, and storage, and pay for what you use.

AMI (Amazon Machine Image): A template that contains the operating system and base software. This project uses the official Ubuntu Server AMI.

Instance type (t2.micro): Defines the hardware: 1 vCPU and 1 GiB RAM, which is enough for a static website. Free Tier eligibility depends on your account and region, so check your AWS Billing page.

Key pair: A public/private key pair used for SSH login instead of a password. AWS stores the public key on the server, and you keep the private .pem file. If you lose it, you lose SSH access.

Security Group: A virtual, stateful firewall attached to the instance. By default it blocks all inbound traffic, so each needed port must be allowed explicitly.

Port	Protocol	Purpose
22	SSH	Remote administration
80	HTTP	Public web traffic
Nginx: A high-performance web server and reverse proxy, known for handling many concurrent connections with low memory use.

systemd / systemctl: The Linux service manager that starts, stops, and enables services at boot.

Document root: The folder from which the web server serves files. For Nginx installed with apt on Ubuntu, it is /var/www/html.

6. Step-by-Step Implementation
Step 1: Open EC2 in the AWS Console
Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
Select your preferred region (top-right corner).
Search for EC2 and open the dashboard.
Step 2: Launch the instance
Click Launch instance and configure:

Setting	Value
Name	MyWebServer
AMI	Ubuntu Server (latest LTS)
Instance type	t2.micro
Key pair	Create new, RSA, .pem format
Public IP	Auto-assign enabled
Storage	8 GiB (default)
Download the .pem file immediately. AWS shows it only once.

Step 3: Configure the Security Group
Create a security group with these inbound rules:

Type	Protocol	Port	Source	Reason
SSH	TCP	22	My IP	Only I can administer the server
HTTP	TCP	80	0.0.0.0/0	Anyone can view the website
Click Launch instance, wait for the state to show Running with 2/2 status checks passed, then copy the Public IPv4 address.

Step 4: Connect via SSH
Protect the key file (SSH rejects keys with open permissions):

chmod 400 your-key.pem
Connect (the default Ubuntu user is ubuntu, not ec2-user):

ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@<your-instance-public-ip>
Type yes when asked to trust the host.

Step 5: Update the system
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y
Step 6: Install Nginx
sudo apt install nginx -y
Step 7: Start and enable Nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
start runs the service now.
enable makes it start automatically on every boot.
Verify:

sudo systemctl status nginx
The output should show active (running). Press q to exit.

Step 8: Firewall check
Ubuntu includes ufw, which is inactive by default on EC2. Traffic is controlled by the AWS Security Group, so no extra firewall configuration is needed.

sudo ufw status
Expected: Status: inactive

The firewall-cmd commands seen in many tutorials are for Amazon Linux / RHEL, not Ubuntu.

Step 9: Test the default page
Open http://<your-instance-public-ip> in a browser. You should see "Welcome to nginx!". Use http://, not https://, because HTTPS is not configured.

Step 10: Deploy a custom web page
echo "<h1>Welcome to Manju Gowda's Web Server</h1>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
Do not use sudo echo "..." > file. The sudo applies only to echo, while the > redirect runs as your normal user, which fails with Permission denied. Piping into sudo tee avoids this.

For a fuller page:

sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Manju Gowda | AWS EC2 Web Server</title>
  <style>
    body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: center; margin-top: 15%; background: #0f172a; color: #e2e8f0; }
    h1 { color: #38bdf8; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Manju Gowda's Web Server</h1>
  <p>Deployed by Manju Gowda using AWS EC2, Ubuntu, and Nginx</p>
</body>
</html>
Save with Ctrl + O, Enter, then exit with Ctrl + X.

On Ubuntu, the document root is /var/www/html. The path /usr/share/nginx/html applies to Amazon Linux / RHEL.

Step 11: Access the website
Refresh http://<your-instance-public-ip>. Your custom page should appear.

Step 12: Confirm auto-start after reboot
sudo systemctl is-enabled nginx
sudo reboot
Wait about a minute, reconnect over SSH, and run sudo systemctl status nginx. If Nginx is active (running) without being started manually, the setup is reboot-safe.

A reboot keeps the public IP, but stopping and starting the instance changes it. Use an Elastic IP for a permanent address.

7. Verification and Testing
Test	Command / Action	Expected result
Service running	sudo systemctl status nginx	active (running)
Port listening	sudo ss -tulnp | grep :80	Nginx on port 80
Local response	curl http://localhost	Returns the HTML
Config syntax	sudo nginx -t	syntax is ok
Public access	Browser: http://<public-ip>	Custom page displays
HTTP headers	curl -I http://<public-ip>	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Reboot survival	sudo reboot, then check status	Nginx runs automatically
8. Useful Commands
# Service control
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl reload nginx        # apply config changes without downtime
sudo systemctl status nginx

# Configuration
sudo nginx -t                      # test configuration
sudo nginx -v                      # show version

# Logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
Key locations

Path	Purpose
/var/www/html/	Website files (document root)
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf	Main configuration
/etc/nginx/sites-available/	Site configuration files
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/	Active sites (symlinks)
/var/log/nginx/	Access and error logs
9. Troubleshooting
Problem	Likely cause	Fix
Browser: connection timed out	Port 80 not open in Security Group	Add inbound HTTP rule (TCP 80)
Browser: connection refused	Nginx not running	sudo systemctl start nginx
Page fails on https://	HTTPS not configured	Use http:// or set up SSL
SSH: Permission denied (publickey)	Wrong user or key	Use ubuntu@ and the correct .pem
SSH: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE	Key permissions too open	chmod 400 your-key.pem
SSH: connection timed out	Port 22 blocked or your IP changed	Update the SSH rule to your current IP
Permission denied writing index.html	sudo echo > file mistake	echo "..." | sudo tee file
Old page still showing	Browser cache	Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
Default page shows instead of mine	Wrong folder or file name	Confirm /var/www/html/index.html exists
IP changed after stopping instance	Public IPs are dynamic	Allocate an Elastic IP
10. Security Considerations
SSH is restricted to my IP, not 0.0.0.0/0. Open SSH to the world and bots begin brute-forcing it within minutes.
Key-based login only. Password authentication is disabled by default on Ubuntu EC2 images.
The .pem file stays private. Never commit it to GitHub.
Only necessary ports are open (22 and 80). Everything else is blocked by default.
Keep the system patched: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y.
HTTP is unencrypted. This is acceptable for a static demo, but not for logins or personal data.
Billing alerts in AWS Budgets prevent surprise charges.
11. Cost and Cleanup
A t2.micro instance may be covered by the AWS Free Tier, but eligibility depends on your account and region. Verify on your AWS Billing page.

To avoid charges, delete resources when finished:

EC2 → Instances → select the instance → Instance state → Terminate instance
EC2 → Elastic IPs → Release any allocated address
EC2 → Volumes → confirm no leftover volumes
Optionally delete the security group and key pair
Stopping an instance pauses compute charges but storage is still billed. Terminating deletes it.

12. Future Improvements
 Attach an Elastic IP for a permanent address
 Register a domain and point it with Route 53
 Enable HTTPS with Let's Encrypt:
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
 Configure Nginx server blocks to host multiple sites
 Use Nginx as a reverse proxy for a Node.js, Flask, or Django app
 Add a Load Balancer and Auto Scaling Group
 Automate provisioning with Terraform or CloudFormation
 Add CloudWatch monitoring and alarms
 Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions
Bonus: bootstrap the server with EC2 User Data

Paste this under Advanced details → User data when launching, and the server configures itself on first boot:

#!/bin/bash
apt update -y
apt install nginx -y
systemctl enable nginx
systemctl start nginx
echo "<h1>Welcome to Manju Gowda's Web Server</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
